# Introduction

This repository contains a practical example about how to build a LLM Q&A app capable of answering questions related to your private documents in just a couple of hours.

> Previously, I built a Q&A app using Azure OpenAI GPT-4 and Pinecone _(you can find it in [here](https://github.com/karlospn/building-qa-app-with-openai-pinecone-and-streamlit))_.   
> In this repository I will built exactly the same app but using only AWS services (+ Streamlit for the UI).

To be more precise, the app uses the following technologies:

- [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock)
- [AWS Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

Work in progress.
